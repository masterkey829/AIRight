# Collecting the Public’s Perception of AI and Robot Rights

Guidelines for understanding the declarative statements presented to participants.

## 1. Agent
- <b>AI</b>
- <b>Robot</b>

## 2. Level of Autonomy
We present robots and AI in two different forms.
- <b>Standard</b>: Merely calling them AI and robots (i.e., 'AI programs', 'robots')
- <b>Autonomous</b>: Explicitly introducing AI and robots as completely autonomous  (i.e., 'completely autonomous AI programs', 'completely autonomous robots')

## 3. Phrasing Style
To reduce wording bias, we employed three different styles that were randomly assigned to each participant and right.
- <b>Indirect</b>: Electronic agents (i.e., AI or robot) appear as the object of the statement (e.g., "No one should be able to turn off or kill AI programs.").
- <b>Direct</b>: Electronic agents are the subject of the sentence (e.g., "Robots should receive payment for their work."). 
- <b>Explicit</b>: A variant of the second form, where the word "right" is explicitly used (e.g., "Robots should have the right to be paid for their work.").
