# Collecting the Public’s Perception of AI and Robot Rights

Guildline for interpreting statments for the experiment.

## 1. Agent
1. AI
2. Robot

## 2. Form
We present robots and AI in two different forms.
- Normal : Merely calling them as AI and robot / (e.g., 'AI programs' / 'Robots')
- Autonomous: Introducing AI and robots as explicitly entirely autonomous  / (e.g., 'completely autonomous AI programs','completely autonomous robots')

## 3. Phrasing Style
For reducing bias by the words, we employed three different styles that were randomly assigned to each participant.
- <b>Indirect</b>: Electronic agents (i.e., AI or robot) appear as the object of the statement (e.g., "No one should be able to turn off or kill AI programs.").
- <b>Direct</b>: Electronic agents are the subject of the sentence (e.g., "Robots should receive payment for their work."). 
- <b>Explicit</b>: A variant of the second form, where the word "right" is explicitly used (e.g., "Robots should have the right to be paid for their work.").
